- Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags. E.g.
```html
<p> this is a paragpraph </p>
```

- Using the correct tags can have a big impact on two aspects of your sites:
  1. How they are ranked in search engines
  2. How accessible they are to users who rely on assistive technologies, like screen readers, to use the internet.

Using the correct elements for content is called semantic HTML. We will explore this in much more depth later on in the curriculum.

- Some HTML elements do not have a closing tag. These elements are called as 'void elements'.
```html
<img>,  <br> ...
```

! You might also see these referred to as self-closing tags. But those are just void elements with a forward slash(/) at the end like: `<br />` or `<img />`. Youâ€™re likely to see self-closing tags used often for historical reasons. Browsers will be able to render them just fine, but the latest version of the HTML specification discourages their use and considers them invalid.
